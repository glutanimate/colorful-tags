Configuring the tag separator **only works on Anki 2.1.40 and below**. Starting with 2.1.41 and up, the add-on uses Anki's native hierarchical
tags implementation which hardcodes `::` as the tag separator. If your tags
use a different tag separator, you can migrate to `::` by using the *Find and Replace* feature in recent versions of the Anki card browser.

**Please note that you will have to restart Anki for these options to apply**

**Separator** [string]: Separator text between different hierarchical tag levels. Default: `::`
